Cosmonic is a platform for building complex distributed applications and deploying them everywhere. With [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) as our unit of compute, applications can run on any platform in a deny-by-default secure sandbox. With [wasmCloud](https://github.com/wasmcloud) as our runtime, applications can be distributed on any cloud or edge and seamlessly connected as if they were running on the same machine. [Deploy your first application](https://new.cosmonic.app/?yaml=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmonic/awesome-cosmonic/main/xkcdgenerator/xkcd-generator-cosmonic.wadm.yaml) in seconds and see for yourself.
